# VRV ASSESSMENT RBAC - UI 

## **Project Overview**

This project implements a secure authentication and authorization system with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. It allows users to register, log in, and log out securely. Access to specific resources or endpoints is restricted based on the userâ€™s assigned role (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator).

We have utilized **Passport.js** for authentication, ensuring robust security and session management.

   - Users are assigned roles (Admin, User, Moderator).
   - Specific resources and endpoints are protected based on user roles.
   - Middleware ensures role-based authorization for accessing routes.

3. **Technology Stack**:
   - **EJS**: For server-side HTML rendering.
   - **CSS**: For styling the front-end views.
   - **Express.js**: For routing and handling HTTP requests.
   - **Node.js**: As the runtime environment.
   - **MongoDB**: For data storage, integrated via **Mongoose**.
   - **Passport.js**: For secure session-based authentication.
